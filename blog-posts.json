    "content": "I'm currently building Factor Impact Intelligence — a platform that gives everyday investors access to the kind of multi-factor stock analysis that Wall Street pays $25,000+ a year for through Bloomberg terminals. It started as a final project for my Technology Strategy class. It's become something much bigger than that.\nAlong the way, I've learned more about building AI-powered products than any textbook could teach. Not the sanitized \"here's our tech stack\" version — the real version, with the pivots, the cost surprises, and the moments where you realize your brilliant idea needs to be torn apart and rebuilt for actual humans.\nHere's what the journey has looked like so far.\nThe Idea That Was Too Smart for Its Own Good\nThe original vision was ambitious: build an institutional-grade analysis engine that maps supply chain dependencies, geopolitical risks, monetary policy sensitivity, market correlations, and company performance — then synthesize it all into actionable investment signals.\nOn paper, it was compelling. In practice, I was building Bloomberg for people who don't want Bloomberg.\nThe first version of our product spec read like a research paper. Six factor categories. Eighteen sub-factors. Weighted composite scoring models. Inverse correlation hedging recommendations. It was thorough. It was sophisticated. And if I handed it to my mom — an intelligent person who owns stocks through her retirement account — she'd close the tab in about four seconds.\nThat was the first big lesson: the gap between \"technically impressive\" and \"actually useful\" is wider than you think. Especially in fintech, where your users are already overwhelmed by information they don't know how to act on.\nThe Pivot Nobody Warns You About\nEvery startup blog talks about pivoting like it's a single dramatic moment. Ours was more like a slow realization over several weeks.\nWe didn't change what the product does — we changed who it's for and how it communicates. The underlying analysis engine still runs the same six-factor model. But instead of presenting raw composite scores and factor weights, we started designing around metaphors people already understand.\nWhat if risk levels looked like a weather forecast? What if factor health was a traffic light — green, yellow, red — instead of a number between negative two and positive two?\nThis isn't dumbing things down. It's actually harder. You have to deeply understand the analysis to translate it into something intuitive without losing the signal. Anyone can show a chart. Making someone feel informed in thirty seconds — that's a design problem, not a data problem.\nApps like Robinhood and Acorns proved this years ago. Robinhood didn't invent stock trading. They made it feel approachable. Acorns didn't invent investing. They removed the decision paralysis. The pattern is clear: consumer fintech wins on emotion and simplicity, not on feature count.\nThe Real Economics of Building With AI\nHere's something I wish someone had told me before I started: building with AI APIs is cheap to prototype and expensive to be naive about.\nOur stack uses Claude's API for the heavy lifting — analyzing SEC filings, extracting supply chain relationships from unstructured text, generating the plain-English reasoning behind each recommendation. Early estimates put the cost at roughly seventy-five cents per company for a full analysis. That sounds like nothing.\nBut then you start thinking about scale. Fifty stocks in your initial coverage universe. Daily refreshes for macro factors. Users requesting on-demand analysis. Suddenly you're doing math on API costs that would make a college student sweat.\nWe explored building a Small Language Model — fine-tuning a lighter model specifically for financial report analysis to reduce our dependence on the Claude API. I spent time researching Hugging Face, PEFT libraries, GPU rental costs. The conclusion? For our stage, it doesn't make sense. The development time and compute costs for training a custom model far exceed what we'd save on API calls. That calculus will change at scale, but right now, the best model is the one that lets you ship.\nThe other hidden cost is debugging. When your application spans AWS Lambda functions, DynamoDB, S3 buckets, Secrets Manager, and three different external APIs (Finnhub, FRED, Claude), things break in creative ways. I spent an entire evening troubleshooting IAM permissions — the kind of unglamorous work that never makes it into product demos but consumes real hours. A batch processing job that should have been straightforward turned into a lesson about permission boundaries, environment variables, and the importance of systematic debugging.\nWhat I've Learned About Finding Whitespace\nBefore writing a single line of code, I did something that ended up being the most valuable part of the entire project: I mapped the competitive landscape obsessively.\nI went through every retail investing platform I could find — Koyfin, Simply Wall St, FinChat, Danelfin, Fiscal.ai — and built feature matrices comparing what they offer. The finding surprised me: not a single retail tool combines supply chain analysis with macro factor modeling. Not one. At any price point.\nEven more telling, I looked at Y Combinator's recent batches. Every supply chain startup funded in 2024-2025 is focused on B2B operations — helping companies manage their own supply chains. Nobody is building supply chain intelligence for investors.\nThat's when the project shifted from \"interesting class assignment\" to \"this might actually be something.\" The whitespace isn't just a gap in features. It's a gap in thinking — an entire category of analysis that thirty-five million active US stock researchers simply cannot access today.\nWhat's Next\nWe have a working backend that can process batches of fifty stocks, score them across all six factors, and generate AI-powered recommendations. The next phase is building the consumer interface — the Streamlit app with the weather metaphors, the traffic lights, the progressive disclosure that hides complexity until you want it.\nI'm also exploring adjacent opportunities, like how payroll platforms could become distribution channels for investment tools. But that's a story for another post.\nIf there's one takeaway from this experience, it's this: building an AI-powered product is 20% AI and 80% everything else — understanding your user, finding real whitespace, making hard decisions about scope, and accepting that the elegant technical solution isn't always the right one.\nThe institutional investors will keep their Bloomberg terminals. But the next generation of retail investors deserves better than stock prices and news headlines. That's what we're building toward.\n\n",
